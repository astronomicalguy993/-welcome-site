<h2>Paragliding in Spain: A Ukrainian's Joy</h2>
<img src="paraglider.jpg" alt="Paraglider in the sky" width="300">

<p>
  For many Ukrainians living or visiting Spain, paragliding offers not just an adventure, but a deep breath of freedom and beauty.
  The vast Spanish skies, gentle winds, and breathtaking views from above give a sense of lightness that helps leave worries behind.
</p>

<p>
  It's more than a sport — it's a reminder that peace and wonder still exist.
  Flying over the hills and coastlines, many feel closer to home, to nature, and to themselves.
